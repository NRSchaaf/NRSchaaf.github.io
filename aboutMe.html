  <h3>
    About Me
  </h3>
  <p>I am originally from Lexington, NC but I grew up in Birmingham, AL. After graduating high school in 2000 I held several jobs while I determined my next steps in life.
    In 2005 I decided to follow my father's footsteps and was hired at Norfolk Southern Company where I have been ever since. I have had the privilege of holding several 
    positions within the company which has afforded me a wide range of knowledge and opportunities. I have enjoyed my career here and look forward to future challenges. 
  </p>
  <p>I am married to Rev. Allysen Schaaf, Associate Pastor for Contemporary Worship and Community Building at <a href="https://sardis.org/">Sardis Presbyterian Church</a> in Charlotte, NC. Being married to a 
    Pastor has its perks. It means we are never bored as there is always something we can be involved in, and it means we have lots of contacts and friends to hang out with. 
    It also affords me the opportunity to improve my French Horn and Alto Saxophone playing skills. We have one child who is an absolute joy! And we are fortunate to have 
    family living nearby who we see regularly. 
  </p>
  <p>A unique thing about me is that since I was 14 years old I have been a FIFA soccer referee. At age 16 I was often a center referee for the local adult league which taught 
    me at a young age how to manage people, especially people who are older or may be more experienced. I would have to say that refereeing soccer has provided me with more 
    experience and knowledge about people management than any other thing I have engaged in, including managing employees at work.
  </p>
  <p>Another unique thing about me is that I am an Eagle Scout and enjoy all outdoor activities. Camping with my family is always fun, and we took our child on his first tent 
    camping trip when he was only 1 year old. During my free time I like to hit the mountain trout streams and fly fish. I also enjoy playing sports like soccer, golf, and 
    pickle ball. And my wife likes to say my hobby is finding new hobbies, so I enjoy model railroading, programming, analytics, cooking (Iâ€™m a great cook), playing instruments, 
    kayaking, and just about anything else.
