      East Palestine Data Portal Taskforce
    </h3>
    <p>On February 3, 2023, around 8:54pm CST, Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) general merchandise freight train 32N derailed 38 cars in East Palestine, OH. The derailed equipment
      included 11 tank cars carrying hazardous materials, 8 of which had a release. <br>
      As part of the incident command structure (ICS), the East Palestine Data Portal Taskforce was formed to facilitate data sharing between NS, emergency & environmental
      response contractors, and the US EPA, other federal agencies, and state and local agencies. At the request of the NS Law Department, I was asked to head this task force and
      coordinte the data sharing effort. A simple and quick solution was to use a SharePoint Online site which has been very successful. This elminated the use of email for information 
      transmittal, and provides a single source for records and records history. This also allowed us to meet legal hold and records retention requirements and assign permissions to documents
      appropriately as needed. <br>
